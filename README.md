# Security Copilot in Defender — Tools & Remediation

Unofficial PowerShell scripts and ARM templates to help administrators run security simulations, validate threat detection, and remediate known issues in Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel.

## 🛡️ Scripts

This repository contains the following PowerShell scripts:

### Kubernetes Alert Simulation Script

Deploy-KubernetesAlertSimulation.ps1 - Automates Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Kubernetes attack simulation to validate threat detection on AKS clusters.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Validate that Microsoft Defender for Containers is properly configured and detecting threats |
| **Documentation** | 📖 **[Complete Walkthrough Guide](docs/Kubernetes-Alert-Simulation-Guide.md)** |
| **Version** | 2.2.0 (December 2025) |
| **Requirements** | PowerShell 7.0+, Azure CLI, kubectl, Helm, Python 3.7+ |

#### Quick Start

```powershell
# Run interactively (recommended for first-time users)
.\Deploy-KubernetesAlertSimulation.ps1

# Run on a specific cluster
.\Deploy-KubernetesAlertSimulation.ps1 -ClusterName "my-cluster" -ResourceGroup "my-rg"

# Run all scenarios with automatic cleanup
.\Deploy-KubernetesAlertSimulation.ps1 -SimulationScenario All -CleanupAfterRun
```

#### Key Features

- ✅ **Automatic prerequisite installation** via winget
- ✅ **Azure permission validation** with least-privilege recommendations
- ✅ **Option to create a new non-prod AKS cluster** for testing
- ✅ **Visual progress bar** for cluster deployment
- ✅ **Production cluster detection** with safety warnings
- ✅ **Comprehensive cost analysis** and estimates
- ✅ **Detailed HTML report generation** with expected alerts
- ✅ **Complete cleanup** of simulation resources

#### Attack Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Key Alerts Generated |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Reconnaissance | Network scanning, service enumeration | Network scanning tool detected |
| Lateral Movement | IMDS access, token retrieval | Access to cloud metadata service detected |
| Secrets Gathering | Credential file access | Sensitive files access detected |
| Crypto Mining | Mining software simulation | Digital currency mining behavior detected |
| Web Shell | Remote command execution | Possible Web Shell activity detected |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Run only on non-production clusters. See the [complete guide](docs/Kubernetes-Alert-Simulation-Guide.md) for detailed instructions and safety considerations.

## 🔧 Remediation Playbooks

### Restore Sentinel Incident Tags

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fiamjoeycruz%2Fsecuritycopilotindefender%2Fmain%2Fremediation%2Frestore-sentinel-incident-tags%2Fazuredeploy.json)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem** | The Phishing Triage Agent and Defender XDR alert correlation remove tags/labels from Sentinel incidents, breaking tag-based automation |
| **Root Cause** | Sentinel's PUT API uses full-replace semantics — omitting the `labels` field deletes all tags |
| **Solution** | Logic App playbook that auto-restores required tags within seconds of removal |
| **Documentation** | 📖 **[Deployment Guide](remediation/restore-sentinel-incident-tags/README.md)** |
| **Cost** | < $1/month (Logic App Consumption tier) |
