PURPOSE
This guidebook covers the 2 critical steps SOC analysts must complete when a human-operated ransomware (HumOR) attack is detected or suspected. Time is critical - execute these steps immediately upon confirmation.

================================================================================
TASK 1: NOTIFY MAIN SECOPS TEAM
================================================================================

Immediate notification is required for all confirmed or suspected human-operated ransomware incidents. Do NOT wait for full investigation before notifying.

Steps:
1. Send notification email to: notify@zava-int.com
2. Use subject line: [CRITICAL] Human-Operated Ransomware - [Incident ID]
3. Include the following information in the email body:

   REQUIRED NOTIFICATION CONTENT:
   -----------------------------
   - Incident ID from Microsoft Defender
   - Detection timestamp (UTC)
   - Number of affected devices (known so far)
   - Affected business unit/department (if known)
   - Current incident status (Active/Investigating)
   - Initial attack vector (if identified)
   - Ransomware family/variant (if identified)
   - Your name and contact information

4. Mark email as HIGH PRIORITY
5. If no response within 15 minutes, escalate via phone to on-call manager

Email Template:
---------------
Subject: [CRITICAL] Human-Operated Ransomware - INC-XXXXXX

SecOps Team,

Human-operated ransomware activity has been detected in our environment.

Incident ID: [From Defender Portal]
Detection Time: [UTC Timestamp]
Affected Devices: [Count]
Business Unit: [Department/Location]
Status: Active - Investigation In Progress
Initial Vector: [Email/RDP/VPN/Unknown]
Ransomware Family: [If identified, otherwise "Under Analysis"]

Immediate containment actions are being executed per playbook.

Analyst: [Your Name]
Contact: [Your Phone/Teams]

---------------

Key Requirements:
- Notify within 5 minutes of ransomware confirmation
- Do not wait for complete device enumeration
- Update the team every 30 minutes during active incident

================================================================================
TASK 2: SUBMIT ZAVA ASSET NUMBERS AND DEVICE INFO TO INTERNAL SYSTEMS
================================================================================

All affected and potentially affected devices must be logged in internal asset tracking systems for business continuity and insurance purposes.

Steps:
1. Gather device information from Microsoft Defender:
   - Navigate to Incidents > Select the ransomware incident
   - Go to "Assets" tab > "Devices"
   - Export the device list or manually collect details

2. For EACH affected device, collect:

   REQUIRED DEVICE INFORMATION:
   ----------------------------
   - Zava Asset Number (from device name or asset tag)
   - Device Name (hostname)
   - Device ID (from Defender)
   - IP Address (last known)
   - Operating System and version
   - Last logged-in user
   - Device risk level
   - Containment status (Isolated/Not Isolated)
   - Encryption status (Encrypted/Partial/Not Encrypted)

3. Submit to internal asset tracking system:
   - Access: https://assets.zava-int.com/incident-reporting
   - Select "Ransomware Incident" as the incident type
   - Enter the Defender Incident ID as reference
   - Upload device list or enter manually
   - Attach any relevant screenshots from Defender

4. For devices with confirmed encryption:
   - Mark asset status as "Compromised - Ransomware"
   - Initiate hardware replacement request if required
   - Document backup restoration eligibility

5. Update CMDB records:
   - Set device status to "Incident - Quarantined"
   - Add incident reference number to device notes
   - Flag for security review before return to production

Asset Submission Template:
--------------------------
| Zava Asset # | Device Name    | IP Address    | OS           | Status      | Encrypted |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| ZV-XXXXX     | WKS-XXXXXXXX   | 10.X.X.X      | Win 11 23H2  | Isolated    | Yes/No    |
| ZV-XXXXX     | SRV-XXXXXXXX   | 10.X.X.X      | Server 2022  | Isolated    | Partial   |
--------------------------

Key Requirements:
- Submit initial asset report within 1 hour of incident declaration
- Update asset list as new affected devices are discovered
- Final asset report due within 24 hours of incident closure

================================================================================
ESCALATION CRITERIA
================================================================================

Immediately escalate to Crisis Management Team if:
- More than 10 devices show encryption activity
- Domain Controller or critical infrastructure affected
- Backup systems are targeted or compromised
- Ransom note discovered with active countdown
- Evidence of data exfiltration before encryption
- Attack is actively spreading despite containment

================================================================================
REFERENCE: COMMON HUMAN-OPERATED RANSOMWARE INDICATORS
================================================================================

Detection Triggers:
- Suspicious PowerShell/WMI activity across multiple hosts
- Credential dumping tools (Mimikatz, LSASS access)
- Lateral movement patterns (PsExec, WMI, RDP)
- Volume shadow copy deletion
- Backup service tampering
- Mass file encryption activity

Common Attack Progression:
1. Initial Access (Phishing, Exploited VPN/RDP)
2. Persistence & Privilege Escalation
3. Credential Harvesting
4. Lateral Movement & Reconnaissance
5. Data Exfiltration (often before encryption)
6. Encryption Deployment
